# Web_Quiz_Api

This program utilizes a pre-existing code as a foundation to construct a coding quiz that is timed and consists of several questions with multiple-choice answers. The quiz will operate within a web browser and can modify the appearance of the page in real-time using JavaScript code.

# Main Components

The quiz that is timed has the ability to save scores for various users.

Upon clicking the start button, the timer is activated, and the first question will display.

When a user selects an answer, the subsequent question will appear.

The answer is checked each time, and an audio effect and message will appear to inform the user if their choice is correct.

If the selection is incorrect, 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer.

The quiz will conclude once all questions have been answered or the timer has run out.

Upon completion, users will have the option to save their initials and score.

Users may also view the high score list, which includes scores from other users.

The application will feature a sleek, refined, and adaptable user interface.
